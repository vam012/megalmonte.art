			<h1>Merch4Relief</h1>
			<p>
				Merch4Relief was set up in order to help restaurants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, I was paired up with multiple restaurants across the United States and encapsulated their restraunts style and atmosphere on a piece of clothing.  
				This page will house the final design for each of the restaurants that I worked with as well as a small write-up about my thoughts about the peice and why I chose each as the final design.  
				You can see all of the designs on my Merch4Relief collection page located <a href="https://www.merch4relief.com/collections/megan-almonte">here.</a>
